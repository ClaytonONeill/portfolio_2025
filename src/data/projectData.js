    description:
      "Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) is the collection, integration, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data from environmental hazard monitoring and from human health effects surveillance. Tracking aims to protect communities by providing useful environmental and health data to federal, state, and local agencies. These agencies can, in turn, use this information to plan, implement, ​and evaluate public health actions to prevent and manage environmentally-related diseases. EPHT allows public health agencies to monitor and disseminate information about environmental factors and disease trends, engage in research on potential linkages between environmental factors and health conditions, and implement and evaluate policies to help prevent or control environmentally-related diseases.​",

      "MTA TIGERS is a centralized platform developed for the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) that consolidates key environmental data—including stormwater inspections, hazardous materials inventories, waste management records, air quality monitoring, and facility compliance histories—into a unified, real-time interface. The system features curated interactive maps, dynamic charting components, and at-a-glance indicators that display compliance status, permit summaries, and environmental risk levels across all MDOT facilities. A built-in custom reporting engine generates EPA-ready documentation for audits and regulatory submissions, enabling streamlined oversight and supporting continuous adherence to state and federal environmental standards.",

This was a coordinated effort between our team at CGIS, Towson University's Department of Creative Services, and the Office of Technology Services.  This map was built to be accessibility forward with custom extensions developed to optimize screen reader functionality and keyboard navigation.  This new map also added in much greater level of control over map features and layer configurations to offer users a more customizable experience.  This map will be going live in the next couple months!",
