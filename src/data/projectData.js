    description:
      "Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) is the collection, integration, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data from environmental hazard monitoring and from human health effects surveillance. Tracking aims to protect communities by providing useful environmental and health data to federal, state, and local agencies. These agencies can, in turn, use this information to plan, implement, ​and evaluate public health actions to prevent and manage environmentally-related diseases. EPHT allows public health agencies to monitor and disseminate information about environmental factors and disease trends, engage in research on potential linkages between environmental factors and health conditions, and implement and evaluate policies to help prevent or control environmentally-related diseases.​",
