    description:
      "Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) is the collection, integration, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data from environmental hazard monitoring and from human health effects surveillance. Tracking aims to protect communities by providing useful environmental and health data to federal, state, and local agencies. These agencies can, in turn, use this information to plan, implement, ​and evaluate public health actions to prevent and manage environmentally-related diseases. EPHT allows public health agencies to monitor and disseminate information about environmental factors and disease trends, engage in research on potential linkages between environmental factors and health conditions, and implement and evaluate policies to help prevent or control environmentally-related diseases.​",

    description:
      "MTA TIGERS is a centralized platform developed for the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) that consolidates key environmental data—including stormwater inspections, hazardous materials inventories, waste management records, air quality monitoring, and facility compliance histories—into a unified, real-time interface. The system features curated interactive maps, dynamic charting components, and at-a-glance indicators that display compliance status, permit summaries, and environmental risk levels across all MDOT facilities. A built-in custom reporting engine generates EPA-ready documentation for audits and regulatory submissions, enabling streamlined oversight and supporting continuous adherence to state and federal environmental standards.",

      "The Maryland Defense Network (MDN) allows users to make meaningful connections, understand government contracting opportunities, grow business prospects, and assess the overall defense industry impact. MDN was created through a Defense Industry Adjustment grant offered to the Maryland Department of Commerce by the US Department of Defense, Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation. The grant was executed in conjunction with Towson University’s Regional Economics Studies Institute and Center for GIS.",

      "This project was a complete reconstruction of the Towson University campus map.  This was a coordinated effort between our team at CGIS, Towson University's Department of Creative Services, and the Office of Technology Services.  This map was built to be accessibility forward with custom extensions developed to optimize screen reader functionality and keyboard navigation.  This new map also added in much greater level of control over map features and layer configurations to offer users a more customizable experience.  This map will be going live in the next couple months!",

    title: "Web Development Resource Hub",
    description:
      "As the final assignment in my Web and Digital Design CMST 388 course I built the Web Development Resource Hub using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, focusing on clean structure, accessible design, and efficient client-side functionality without relying on external frameworks. The purpose of the site is to act as a centralized resource hub for developers, giving them quick access to essential documentation, reference guides, and articles covering key web development and design concepts. By organizing this material into a clear, easy-to-navigate layout, the project supports learners who want a straightforward place to review foundational topics, explore best practices, and strengthen their understanding of front-end principles. It also demonstrates my ability to build practical, responsive tools completely from the ground up.",

    description:
      "The Pit Bull Protection Program was a personal design assignment created for a fictional company as part of my Web and Digital Design 387 course. The goal was to explore and apply core front-end concepts in a practical, real-world scenario. I focused heavily on responsive design, ensuring that every page adapted smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts. I also implemented simple routing and incorporated foundational JavaScript logic to support interactive elements and dynamic content. Although the company itself was fictional, the project allowed me to practice building a polished, user-friendly interface from scratch while strengthening my understanding of modern design principles and front-end development workflows.",
